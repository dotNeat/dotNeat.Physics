### International System of Quantities (ISQ)
The International System of Quantities (ISQ) is a system based on seven base quantities: 
length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. 
Other quantities such as area, pressure, and electrical resistance are derived from these base quantities by clear, non-contradictory equations. 
The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units[1] and also includes many other quantities in modern science and technology.
